# My Stars Team Project
This project is designed to assist a stargazer in determining if a specific location is amenable to viewing the stars.  Factors used in determining this are an image of the night sky including constellations (in black mode), the current weather and the moon phase. The stargazer interacts with the application by inputting their location and initial type of star map they'd like to see(?? or are we defaulting to black to start).  The star map variations are also selectable after the initial display to provide different views of the night sky. The weathermap can be zoomed out to obtain a bigger picture of weather forecast.   This project uses three APIs: the Astronomy API, OpenWeather API and Leaflet.js. 

## Installation
No installation required.  The web application can be reached by navigating in the browser to: 

## Usage
As a stargazer, so that I can see what stars or constellations are visible from that location
I am able to select a city from which to view the stars    
And I am presented with a starmap of the night sky.

As a stargazer, when I am viewing the star map I would like to view different perspectives of the night sky,  
So I am able to change the data in the style and zoom inputs, and click the submit button 
And I am presented with a map that reflects those updated values.  

As a stargazer, when I am planning on viewing the night sky, 
I want to be able to determine if tonight is a good night to view the stars,  
So I am presented with a map of the current clouds and precipitation

As a stargazer, when I am planning on viewing the night sky,  
I want to be able to plan what time I can set aside for viewing  
And I am presented with the sunset and moonrise times.  

As a stargazer, when I am planning on viewing the night sky,  
I want to be sure the light of the moon does not obstruct my view  
And I am presented with the current moon phase.  

As a stargazer, I want to be able to be comfortable when viewing the stars,  
So I am able to determine what clothing I will need to wear   
I will be presented with a weather summary.
